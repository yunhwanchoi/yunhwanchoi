## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name is Yun Choi

- I am an aspiring data scientist who loves drawing interesting insights from data and communicating them by using analytical tools!
- I graduated Northwestern University in 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Engineering with a Minor in Data Science
- Experience coding in Python, R, and SQL
- Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge and skills and practicing my skills in various ML algorithms, Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, Sabermetrics, and creating interactive visualization tools with Shiny and Tableau
- The repositories contain a variety of assignments and projects I've partaken in. I am constantly updating this page over the course of my learning

## Projects

**Predicting Absenteeism**\
The main goal of the project is prediction of the hours of absenteeism using regression algorithms. Various types of models such as linear regression, random forest, and boosting was used to conduct regression to predict the hours of absenteeism for each attribute of absence, as well as determine the most important predictors for absenteeism.\

**Tuning and Comparing Regression Models on Wildfires Dataset**\
The following walks through a step by step model tuning/model selection process on provided training and test datasets wildfires_train and wildfires_test. I built various candidate models using tree-based regression algorithms and linear regression on the training set. Candidate models were evaluated on a provided test set.\

**EDA of MLB Batters from 1985 to 2020**\
I conducted basic exploratory data analysis to explore patterns and correlations within an MLB batter's performance metrics dating from 1985. I also attempted to highlight important factors that contribute to a team reaching the postseason (playoffs). I plan to use some of the insights gained from the following rudimentary data exploration for other personal projects such as using machine learning to determine whether a team is undervaluing or overvaluing a player, understanding player performance regression, as well as predicting the number of team wins given historical stats of players in the team.\
