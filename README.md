### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name is Yun Choi

I am an aspiring data scientist who loves drawing interesting insights from data and communicating them by using analytical tools!

I graduated Northwestern University in 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Engineering with a Minor in Data Science

Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge and skills and practicing my skills in various ML algorithms, Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, Sabermetrics, and creating interactive visualization tools with Shiny and Tableau.

The repositories contain a variety of assignments and projects I've partaken in, as well as various notes. I am constantly updating this page over the course of my learning.
